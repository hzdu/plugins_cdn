- We have started to add a new generation of starter sites called Expert Sites, which are more complex and cover a more variety of sections and integrations for each niche. Furthermore, we have started to review and convert some of the older ones to Expert Sites and you will see them available soon. To support this change, you will see a lighter starter site collection than we had in the past as we want to focus on a smaller but more powerful collection of ready-to-use sites which we can constantly update. You will still be able to access the legacy starter sites by [following this doc](https://docs.themeisle.com/article/1613-where-do-i-find-the-legacy-the-starter-sites), but keep in mind that those will no longer receive updates or be tested with the latest versions.

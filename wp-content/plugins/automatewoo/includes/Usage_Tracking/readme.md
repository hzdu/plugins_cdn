# AutomateWoo Usage Tracking

The files within this directory implement usage tracking for AutomateWoo. This builds on the native [WooCommerce Usage Tracking](https://woocommerce.com/usage-tracking/), and is only enabled when WooCommerce Tracking is enabled.

When a store opts in to WooCommerce usage tracking and they use AutomateWoo, they will also be opted in to the tracking added by AutomateWoo.

## What we track

Similar to WooCommerce, we track non-sensitive data about how a store is set up and managed. We **do not track or store personal data** from your clients.

* Plugin version
* Settings:
  * Whether opt-in is enabled, whether the checkbox is available on the checkout page, and whether the checkbox is available on the account sign-up page
  * Whether session tracking is enabled
  * Whether session tracking requires cookie consent and the name of the cookie
  * Whether presubmit capture is enabled
  * Whether the abandoned cart feature is enabled
  * Whether the communication account tab is enabled
  * Whether any of these integrations are in use: Mailchimp, Campaign Monitor, Active Campaign, Twilio, Bitly
* The names of actions that are in use
* The name of triggers that are in use
* The number of active automatic workflows
* The number of manual workflows
* The number of conversions that have been made
* The total value of all conversions
* Workflow Log data:
  * Number of times workflows have run
  * Number of times a workflow ran with conversion tracking enabled
  * Number of times a workflow ran with tracking enabled

We also track certain user and store events, including when AutomateWoo is first installed, when a workflow is first created, when a workflow runs, and when a conversion is recorded.

## Raw tracking data

== Description ==
If the customer can't pay with your payment gateways, give him the opportunity to submit the order and send to you a note on payment options he can pay you with. The plugin is very simple and effective. The more important is it's very easy to setup and use.

### Customer Message
A gateway description appears to the customer at the Checkout page to provide him with additional information about your custom gateway.

### Customer Note
A note for the customer for further instructions displayed after the checkout process.


## Pro Features
